# alien-shooter-game
A game where players can control the ship with mouse freely and auto-fires. There are 5 levels, 4 of them are single player. Last level is multiplayer where you wait for other players to finish other levels.

*  For back-end we used [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
*  For front-end we used [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)
*  We used [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) server as our relational database server.
*  Multiplayer phase is achieved using sockets.
*  `build.sh` creates `client` and `server` executables.
